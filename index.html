            <p class="fontjustify">What is the difference between a web designer and a web developer? In the early days
                of the web, the answer to that question was simple: designers design and developers code. Today that
                question requires a little more nuance—you'd be hard pressed to find a web designer who didn't know at
                least a little HTML and CSS, and you won't have to look far for a front-end web developer who can whip
                up a storyboard. If you're strictly speaking about the general concepts of web design vs. web
                development, however, the distinction is a little more clear. Let's take a look at these two concepts
                and the roles they play in building the functioning websites and apps we know and love.</p><br><br>

            <p>Web development governs all the code that makes a website tick. It can be split into two
                categories—front-end and back-end. The front-end or client-side of an application is the code
                responsible for determining how the website will actually display the designs mocked up by a designer.
                The back-end or server-side of an application is responsible for managing data within the database and
                serving that data to the front-end to be displayed. As you may have guessed, it’s the front-end
                developer’s job that tends to share the most overlap with the web designer.</p><br><br>

            <p>Back-end developers handle the business logic and data management on the back-end of an application. They
                write the APIs and routing that allow data to flow between the front and back end of an application.

            <p>The cost of hiring a web developer tends to be higher than the cost of hiring a web designer. According
                to ZipRecruiter, the average rate of web developers is $36/hr while the average rate of web designers is
                $29/hour. The primary reason for this discrepancy is likely supply and demand—there are more designers
                than developers, and coding in general is a highly sought after skill. As coding becomes more ubiquitous
                among the talent pool the discrepancy between rates decreases. When it comes to expertise, whether
                hiring developers or designers you are paying for experience.</p>
